:rule-name: nameOfNbtKey
:linter: nameConvention
:description: This rule enforces a consistent naming convention for keys in NBT compound tags and NBT paths.
include::_header.adoc[]

This linter only checks the naming in the following cases:

* This is a key definition in an nbtdoc compound definition block that is outside of the `::minecraft` module;
* This is a key used in an NBT compound tag that doesn't have an associated nbtdoc definition; OR
* This is a key used in an NBT path that doesn't have an associated nbtdoc definition.

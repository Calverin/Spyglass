## 🌐 Localization

[![Localization status](https://dhp.spgoding.com/widgets/datapack-helper-plus/-/multi-auto.svg)](https://dhp.spgoding.com/engage/datapack-helper-plus/?utm_source=widget)

Datapack Helper Plus supports multiple languages. If you'd like to help us translate this project to your language, it would be really appreciated!

### Steps

1. Go to the [localization website](https://dhp.spgoding.com).
2. [Register](https://dhp.spgoding.com/accounts/register) by linking your GitHub account (recommended), or using your email.
    - Note that the username and email will be shown in the [repository](https://github.com/SPGoding/datapack-language-server)'s git commit log. If you don't feel like you want to disclose your own email address, feel free to [contact SPGoding](https://github.com/SPGoding/datapack-language-server/wiki/Contact-SPGoding) to get an account with a fake email address.
3. See two components of DHP [here](https://dhp.spgoding.com/projects/datapack-helper-plus).
4. Start translating!

### Note

- If your language is not listed on the platform, simply [contact SPGoding](https://github.com/SPGoding/datapack-language-server/wiki/Contact-SPGoding);
- If you have suggestions for the source string (`en-us`), please [open an issue](https://github.com/SPGoding/datapack-language-server/issues/new), or discuss with other translators at the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/EbdseuS) if you'd like to.

## 💰 Sponsor

[SPGoding](https://github.com/SPGoding) personally accept financial supports. The funds will be used for purchasing the server which holds the [localization website](https://dhp.spgoding.com), the rest money will be used for SPGoding's personal usage. _Intransparent, huh?_
